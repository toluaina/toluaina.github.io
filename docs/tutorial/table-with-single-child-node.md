With PGSync, we can simply define this [JSON](https://jsonapi.org) schema where the **_book_** table is the pivot.
A **_pivot_** table indicates the root of your document.

```JSON
{
    "table": "book",
    "columns": [
        "isbn",
        "title",
        "description"
    ],
    "children": [
        {
            "table": "author",
            "columns": [
                "name"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Behind the scenes, PGSync is generating advanced queries for you such as.

```SQL
SELECT 
       JSON_BUILD_OBJECT(
          'isbn', book_1.isbn, 
          'title', book_1.title, 
          'description', book_1.description,
          'authors', anon_1.authors
       ) AS "JSON_BUILD_OBJECT_1",
       book_1.id
FROM book AS book_1
LEFT OUTER JOIN
  (SELECT 
          JSON_AGG(anon_2.anon) AS authors,
          book_author_1.book_isbn AS book_isbn
   FROM book_author AS book_author_1
   LEFT OUTER JOIN
     (SELECT
