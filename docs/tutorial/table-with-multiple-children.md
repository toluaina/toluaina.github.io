What if we added a new table `publisher`

**Publisher**

| id *(PK)* | name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Oxford Press |
| 2 | Penguin Books |
| 3 | Pearson Press |

and we added `publisher_id` as a foreign key to the Book table:


**Book**

| isbn *(PK)* | title | description | publisher_id (FK) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 9785811243570 | Charlie and the chocolate factory | Willy Wonka’s famous chocolate factory is opening at last! | 1 |
| 9788374950978 | Kafka on the Shore | Kafka on the Shore is a 2002 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami. | 2 |
| 9781471331435 | 1984 | 1984 was George Orwell’s chilling prophecy about the dystopian future. | 3 |


We can simply define this [JSON](https://jsonapi.org) schema where the **_book_** table is still the pivot table.

```JSON

        "database": "book",
        "index": "book",
        "nodes": {
